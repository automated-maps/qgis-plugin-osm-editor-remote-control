This is a QGIS plugin. It gives you a button in QGIS that sends a command to a
running OSM editor (JOSM and Merkaartor support this) to open the current map
view and download OSM data into the editor.

The map boundary is computed in EPSG:4326 CRS regardless of current
windows's or current layer's CRS.
